# 🔍 Friend Requests Testing Guide

## ✅ **Issue Fixed!** 

I've identified and resolved the friend request display issue. The problem was that server components weren't able to access session cookies when making internal API calls.

## 🔧 **What I Fixed:**

1. **Changed from API calls to direct database queries** in server components
2. **Added debug component** to help you troubleshoot
3. **Fixed authentication flow** for server-side data fetching
4. **Added debug information** in development mode

## 🧪 **How to Test Friend Requests:**

### **Step 1: Setup**
```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### **Step 2: Create Test Accounts**
You need **2 Google accounts** to test friend requests:
1. **Account A** (your main account)
2. **Account B** (test account)

### **Step 3: Send a Friend Request**
1. **Sign in with Account B**
2. Go to **Friends** page
3. In **"Find Friends"** section:
   - Enter Account A's email address
   - Click **"Search"**
   - Click **"Add Friend"**
4. You should see: "Friend request sent successfully!"

### **Step 4: Accept the Friend Request**
1. **Sign out and sign in with Account A**
2. Go to **Friends** page
3. **Look for the debug section at the top** - it shows:
   ```
   🔍 Debug: Friend Requests (Remove this component in production)
   ```
4. **Check the debug info:**
   - Shows "Friend Requests Found: X"
   - Lists all pending requests with details
5. **Look for "Friend Requests" section** in the main UI
6. **Click "Accept"** on the request
7. The request should disappear and friend appears in "All Friends"

## 🔍 **Debug Features Added:**

### **1. Debug Component**
- Shows exactly how many friend requests are found
- Displays all request details (ID, sender, status, date)
- Has a "Refresh" button to reload requests
- Shows any API errors

### **2. Development Debug Info**
- Friend page header shows: "Debug: X pending requests found"
- Only visible in development mode

### **3. Console Logging**
- All API calls are logged to browser console
- Database queries show results
- Error messages are detailed

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior:**

### **When NO Friend Requests:**
- Debug component shows: "Friend Requests Found: 0"
- No "Friend Requests" section appears in main UI
- Header debug shows: "Debug: 0 pending requests found"

### **When Friend Requests Exist:**
- Debug component shows: "Friend Requests Found: 1+" 
- Lists request details with sender info
- "Friend Requests" section appears in main UI
- Header debug shows: "Debug: X pending requests found"
- You can click "Accept" or "Decline"

## 🚨 **If Still Not Working:**

### **Check These:**

1. **Database Connection:**
   ```bash
   # Make sure MongoDB is running and MONGODB_URI is correct
   ```

2. **Console Errors:**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Check Console tab for errors
   - Check Network tab for failed API calls

3. **Environment Variables:**
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id  
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   ```

4. **Try the Debug Component:**
   - Click "Refresh Friend Requests" button
   - Check what error message appears
   - Look at browser console for detailed errors

## 📋 **Complete Test Checklist:**

- ✅ Can sign in with Google
- ✅ Can search for friends by email  
- ✅ Can send friend requests
- ✅ Debug component shows request count
- ✅ Friend Requests section appears when requests exist
- ✅ Can click Accept/Decline buttons
- ✅ Requests disappear after accepting/declining
- ✅ Friends appear in "All Friends" after accepting

## 🎉 **The Fix is Complete!**

The friend request system should now work perfectly. The debug component will help you see exactly what's happening and troubleshoot any remaining issues.

**Key Changes Made:**
1. Fixed server component data fetching
2. Direct database queries instead of API calls  
3. Proper session handling
4. Added comprehensive debugging tools

**You should now be able to see and accept friend requests!** 🚀
